# Social Media Automation

This project provides a framework for automating tasks on various social media platforms using Python, Selenium, Beautiful Soup, and official social media APIs.

## Features

* **Modular Design:** Easily extendable to support new platforms and functionalities.
* **API Integration:**  Prioritizes using official APIs for reliability.
* **Web Scraping:**  Utilizes Beautiful Soup for data extraction when APIs are unavailable.
* **Selenium Automation:**  Controls web browsers for tasks requiring UI interaction.
* **Proxy Support:**  Optionally use proxies for managing rate limits and geo-restrictions (see `core/proxies.py`).
* **Configuration Management:**  Uses `config.ini` for storing API keys and other settings.
* **Unit Tests:**  Includes tests to ensure code quality and reliability.


## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/sane-RK9/browser-use_clone.git`
2. Create a virtual environment: `python3 -m venv .venv`
3. Activate the virtual environment: `source .venv/bin/activate` (Linux/macOS) or `.venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows)
4. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`


## Configuration

1. Create a `data/config.ini` file and add your API keys, usernames, passwords, and other platform-specific settings.  Example:

```ini
[twitter]
api_key = YOUR_TWITTER_API_KEY
api_secret = YOUR_TWITTER_API_SECRET
access_token = YOUR_TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN
access_token_secret = YOUR_TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET

[facebook]
app_id = YOUR_FACEBOOK_APP_ID
app_secret = YOUR_FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET

# ... other platform settings
Use code with caution.
Markdown
(Optional) If using proxies, configure core/proxies.py.

Usage
The main.py script serves as the entry point. You can create different functions within main.py to perform specific automation tasks. Example:

from platforms import twitter

def post_tweet(message):
    tw = twitter.TwitterAPI()  # Initialize Twitter API interaction
    tw.authenticate()  # Authenticate with Twitter
    tw.post(message)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    post_tweet("Hello from my automation script!")
Use code with caution.
